## üîç Overview

The AI-Powered Financial Analyst is designed to help users quickly extract insights from financial reports. By leveraging the power of Large Language Models (specifically Groq's LLama-3), the application can understand complex financial documents and answer questions about them in natural language.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Efficient PDF Text Extraction**: Quickly extracts text from PDF financial reports
- **Advanced Financial Analysis**: Powered by Groq's LLama-3 model (70B parameters)
- **Conversational AI Agent**: Interact with your financial data through natural language
- **Memory Capabilities**: The AI remembers context from your conversation
- **Dual Interface Options**:
  - Command-line interface for quick access
  - Streamlit web interface for a more user-friendly experience
- **PDF Upload**: Easily upload PDF files through the web interface
- **Chat History**: View and track your conversation with the AI analyst
- **Error Handling**: Clear messages for non-text PDFs and extraction issues
- **Optional OCR Support**: Can be enabled for scanned or image-based PDFs

## üíª System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Internet connection (for API calls to Groq)
- 100MB+ of free disk space
- Modern web browser (for Streamlit interface)

## üîß Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI_powered_financial_analyst.git
   cd AI_powered_financial_analyst
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your API key**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Groq API key:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

   You can obtain a Groq API key by signing up at [https://console.groq.com/](https://console.groq.com/)

## üöÄ Usage

### Command Line Interface

1. Place your financial PDF report in the `data/` directory
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. If multiple PDFs are in the directory, you'll be prompted to select one
4. Once the PDF is processed, you can ask questions about the financial report
5. Type 'exit' or 'quit' to end the session

### Streamlit Web Interface

1. Launch the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Your default web browser will open automatically with the application
3. Use the sidebar to upload a financial PDF report
4. Once the PDF is processed, you can ask questions in the chat interface
5. Your conversation history will be displayed in the main area

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **PDF Processing**: The application extracts text from the uploaded PDF using PyMuPDF (fitz)
2. **LLM Integration**: The extracted text is processed by Groq's LLama-3 model via LangChain
3. **Agent Creation**: A conversational agent is created with the financial report context
4. **User Interaction**: Users can ask questions about the report in natural language
5. **Response Generation**: The AI analyzes the report and generates informative responses

## üì∑ Optional OCR Support

If you need to extract text from scanned or image-based PDFs, you can enable OCR support:

1. Uncomment the OCR dependencies in `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   pytesseract>=0.3.10
   Pillow>=9.0.0
   ```

2. Install the updated dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install Tesseract OCR on your system:
   ```bash
   # Run the setup script
   bash setup_ocr.sh
   ```

   Or follow platform-specific instructions:
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`
   - **macOS**: `brew install tesseract`
   - **Windows**: Download from [UB-Mannheim/tesseract](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: Ensure your Groq API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
- **PDF Extraction Errors**: Make sure your PDF is text-based and not scanned/image-based
- **Model Responses**: If responses are incomplete, the PDF might be too large; try with a smaller document
- **Memory Issues**: For very large reports, the system might need more memory; consider splitting the PDF
